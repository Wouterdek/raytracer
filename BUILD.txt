On Windows, vcpkg is recommended as a library package manager.
Install vcpkg, then use it to install:
 eigen3:x64-windows
 eigen3:x86-windows
 boost:x64-windows
 boost:x86-windows
If your vcpkg has gtest installed, this may introduce a version conflict. Try removing it.
Finally, consider clearing the CMake cache and try building.
